# Multiple-Linear-Regression-Model

Model showcasing multiple linear regression.

Very basic multiple linear regression example.

Goal is to apply this model to a more dynamic and dense dataset as my knowledge of the different regression models and data science as a whole increases.

Created w/ Google Colab.
